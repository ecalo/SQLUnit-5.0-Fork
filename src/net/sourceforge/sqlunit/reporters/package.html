Reporter plug-ins for SQLUnit. SQLUnit comes configured with the default text reporter, but provides the ability to hook in a reporter of your choice that works with your existing system. 
All reporter plug-ins should implement the IReporter interface, and needs to provide code that will be executed by SQLUnit for reporting.
<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
The plug-in code was contributed largely by Rob Nielsen. He needed to use SQLUnit with Canoo, so he factored out the reporting code from SQLUnit and made it into the TextReporter, and built the CanooWebTestReporter plug-in.
