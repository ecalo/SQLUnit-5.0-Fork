The PostgreSQL database was used for the first port for SQLUnit because
it is open source and released under the GNU GPL. However, PostgreSQL
supports only the concept of stored functions, which are usually accessed
by saying:
select function();
or:
select * from function();
in the case of cursory stored procedures. The JDBC driver does support the
standard JDBC call syntax, but seems to have bugs as of the time of this
writing. Hence the CallHandler functionality could not be tested with this
suite.
