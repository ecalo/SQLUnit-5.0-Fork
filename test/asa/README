Background Information
----------------------

This test was setup using Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere 9.0.1.1883.
Please read the "Choosing a JDBC Driver section below".


System Description
------------------
The test suite simulates a Human Resources (HR) department.
You can create new departments (IT, HR), then create new employees and 
assign them to a given department.  When adding employees, you can specify
hourly rates, birthdate and social insurance number.  Employee hour rates can
be updated.

Employees can add daily timesheets and monthly reports can be run for
each department summarizing the timesheets.


How to run the test
-------------------
1. Create a new ASA database:
        dbinit asatest.db

2. Start the database:
        dbeng9 asatest.db
        
3. The creation of the schema and data is performed during the test.
   Each time the test is run, the tables are dropped and recreated via the
   <setup> section of test.xml.  The database DDL is provided in the
   schema.sql.  The test models a very simple-minded Human Resources database
   with only three tables: department, employee and timecard.

4. Database Schema

   Database Tables:
     schema.sql - Contains the schema for the HR application.

   Stored Procedures:
     add_dept.sql           - adds a named department to the department table.
     add_employee.sql       - adds a named employee to the employee table.
                              and assigns him to the named department.
     add_timecard.sql       - adds a timecard for a given employee and a 
                              given date. Rudimentary checking is done, 
                              eg, 0 < logged_time < 24.
     get_depts.sql          - returns a list of departments.
                              If a department id is supplied, only the details
                              for that department are returned.
     get_emp_in_dept.sql    - returns a list of all employees in a named
                              department.
     get_emp_by_name.sql    - returns the employee record for a named 
                              employee.
     get_mthly_dept_rpt.sql - returns a report of hours worked by employee
                              for a given department and a given date range.
     upd_rate.sql           - updates the hourly rate for a particular employee.

5. The test.xml file contains the test suite. You can run it with the
   following command at the command prompt from the sqlunit root directory:
     ant sqlunit -Dtestfile=test/asa/test.xml


Choosing a JDBC Driver
----------------------

The test suite by default uses the iAnywhere JDBC driver to connect
to the ASA database, you must be using version 9.0.1.1883 or above of ASA
for the test to work as expected.  It is also possible to use the
Sun JDBC-ODBC bridge.  To change which JDBC driver the test suite uses
read the <connection> section in the test.xml file.

            Choosing a JDBC driver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two JDBC drivers are provided for Adaptive Server Anywhere:

jConnect    
    This driver is a 100% pure Java driver. It communicates with Adaptive
    Server Anywhere using the TDS client/server protocol.

    For jConnect documentation, see  http://sybooks.sybase.com/jc.html.

iAnywhere JDBC driver    
    This driver communicates with Adaptive Server Anywhere using the Command
    Sequence client/server protocol. Its behavior is consistent with ODBC,
    embedded SQL, and OLE DB applications. 

When choosing which driver to use, you may want to consider the following
factors:

Features    
    Both drivers are JDK 2 compliant. The iAnywhere JDBC driver provides
    fully-scrollable cursors, which are not available in jConnect. 

Pure Java    
    The jConnect driver is a pure Java solution. The iAnywhere JDBC driver
    requires the Adaptive Server Anywhere ODBC driver and is not a pure Java
    solution. 

Performance    
    The iAnywhere JDBC driver provides better performance for most purposes
    than the jConnect driver. 

Compatibility    
    The TDS protocol used by the jConnect driver is shared with Adaptive Server
    Enterprise. Some aspects of the driver's behavior are governed by this
    protocol, and are configured to be compatible with Adaptive Server
    Enterprise. 

Both drivers are available on Windows 95/98/Me and Windows NT/2000/XP, as well
as supported UNIX and Linux operating systems. They are not available on
NetWare or Windows CE.
