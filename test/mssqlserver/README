Introduction
============
This text file contains instructions on how to run some canned tests
provided by James Henderson to test SQLUnit on MS SQL Server.

Steps
=====
1. If MS SQL Server is used as the database server, then the JAR files
associated with the JDBC driver for MS SQL Server must be placed within
the "lib" directory.  AS of this writing, those files are msbase.jar, 
mssqlserver.jar, and msutil.jar.  (These JAR files can usually be found in 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Driver for JDBC\lib.)

2. Add the stored procedures within the "mssqlserver" folder, if the
stored procedures do not already exist within the target test database. 


3. Modify the jdbc-url.txt under the "mssqlserver" folder to use the 
URL for the target test database to be used for the MS SQL Server tests.


4. Obtain a command prompt at the root directory for the version of the SQLUnit 
installation that you installed.  Run the mssqlserver test suite to ensure that 
it passes.  Issue the command:

    ant sqlunit-nested -Dtestdir="mssqlserver"

5. Examine results on the console to ensure that there are no test failures.

These tests ensure that issues that have been addressed in previous versions
of SQLUnit still function as advertised.
