Does not strictly belong to a test suite, since MySQL does not support
stored procedures, but included here to demonstrate that SQLUnit is not
limited to regression testing stored procedures only. In case you need
to do development for SQLUnit and dont have access to a database that
supports stored procedures, you can use a strategy similar to the one I 
used.

Running the LOB tests

There are two XML files in this directory. The first, test.xml, tests for
the behavior of BLOBS and CLOBS and verifies that the implementation for
the File and MD5 stuff is correct. The second, test-jos.xml, tests
specifically for the Java Object Support functionality described in the
user guide.

To run these tests, first make sure that you have a schema similar to the
one I tested with. The details can be found in the schema.sql file. Then
you need to populate your database. In addition to running the ant compile
task to compile the SQLUnit proper, you will need to run a second target:

ant compile-test

to compile the MySQL test classes relating to LOB support and Java Object
support. Finally you will need to run:

ant lob-test -Dengine=mysql

to populate the database with blob columns and to generate .ser and .xml 
files for the Java objects to test with later. You will probably need to 
change the test somewhat to replace the md5 checksums with the ones 
generated on your box. To get the md5 checksum for test#3 in test.xml,
simply run:

md5sum /tmp/Dictionary-Larry.ser

and replace the md5sum generated in the text portion of the <col id=2> element
for tests 3, 4, 5 and 6.
