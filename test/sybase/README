Background Information
----------------------
We dont supply the actual stored procedures here, since there could be
intellectual property issues in doing so, but we will supply the tests
and make SQLUnit work with Sybase ASE version 12.5.

This port should also be valid for Microsoft SQL Server since it is very 
similar to Sybase.

If someone can create source code for stored procedures similar to that
described below and modify the sample test.xml file accordingly, that
would be very helpful for people who are trying to use SQLUnit with
Sybase and/or MS-SQL, or trying to write Sybase or MS-SQL stored procedures
for the very first time.

Description of the test cases
-----------------------------
  1) Running a callable statement with a single argument and with a single
return value. This is vanilla code, simply have a select [tuple] from table
where [condition]. This was used to fix some bugs in the CallHandler code.
  2) Running a callable statement with no input parameters and a single
return value. Also vanilla code, this returns a multi-row resultset from
the database.
  3) Running a callable statement with a single input argument and a 
single return value, but which returns multiple resultsets in its result
object. This is possible, at least to my knowledge, with Sybase and MS-SQL
only, so this is important to check out. Some of the resultsets could be
empty, in which case they are represented with an empty resultset tag
(see the sample test.xml included).

The following sprocs were created to test a reported bug
--------------------------------------------------------
TestDataDump.sql -- this is a dummy sproc that just dumps out hardcoded
                    data to match with the sp_TestDataDump test.
TestConvertToNumeric.sql -- this is a wrapper for a char to int convertor
                    using the CONVERT function.
