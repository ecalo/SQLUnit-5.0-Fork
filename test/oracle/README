Directions to extract the files
1. Run "gunzip <filename>" on all the files.   Eg. lnx_920_disk1.cpio.gz
2. Extract the cpio archives with the command "cpio -idmv < <filename>"   Eg. cpio -idmv <lnx_920_disk1.cpio
Important Note: Some browsers will uncompress the files but leave the extension the same (gz) when downloading.  If the above steps do not work for you, try skipping step 1 and go directly to step 2 without changing the filename. Eg. "cpio -idmv <Linux9i_Disk1.cpio.gz"

# This file contains additional datatypes defined by Oracle which are not
# part of the regular JDBC data types. Since SQLUnit aims to be database
# agnostic, this creates a problem since for Oracle stored procedures to 
# run, we need to include the Oracle JDBC driver. Changes to the Oracle
# datatypes will may require redefinition of constants in this file.
