Background Information
----------------------
The port of Informix was started but could not be completed because the 
version of Informix SE 7.24 that I have will not play nice with the Linux 
version (RH 7.3) I am using currently. Specifically, RH started using MD5 
encryption and PAM (pluggable authentication module, using shadow passwords)
for authentication sometime around version 7.0 or earlier, and Informix 
SE 7.24 will not recognize this. No problems are encountered when developing
the stored procedures and adding them to the database locally using 
dbaccess, but since the JDBC driver accesses the database from a socket
connection, the authentication fails since Informix SE 7.24 does not 
understand MD5 passwords. Or so I gather. No workaround is available
except to downgrade the operating system to a point when MD5/PAM was
not implemented. My RH 6.2 machine used to work like this.

I got the the Informix SE 7.24 when Informix was giving away a free copy
for Linux sometime around 1999-2000.

The reason Informix was chosen, apart from it being available , is
because, unlike PostgreSQL, Informix does not have stored functions but
does have stored procedures. So a port to Informix is likely to exercise
SQLUnit's CallHandler module and in the process, make the SQLUnit testing
more complete.

If someone with a recent version of Informix database and JDBC driver 
would undertake the task of running the included tests, and either sending
me any errors or debugging it himself, that would be very helpful for
people who are looking to use SQLUnit with Informix. All the stored 
procedures supplied in this directory run fine through dbaccess.

I have had to use DATE and CHAR(n) instead of the more appropriate (to this
situation) DATETIME and VARCHAR in the stored procedures and the schema,
since SE 7.24 did not have DATETIME and VARCHAR support. Feel free to 
change these datatypes if you want to. Also you may want to write additional
procedures that take advantage of features of current versions of Informix.
Please let me know (spal@users.sourceforge.net) if you would be interested
in completing the Informix port.

The test suite that is currently implemented is described below.

How to run the test
-------------------
  1) The database DDL is provided in the schema.sql. You will need to
install the database first. Its called demodb, but it could be called
anything. It models a very simple-minded Human Resources database with
only three tables: department, employee and timecard.

  2) The stored procedures need to be loaded into the database. Here is 
a list of stored procedures and what they do.
     add_dept.sql - adds a named department to the department table.
     add_employee.sql - adds a named employee to the employee table
       and assigns him to the named department.
     add_timecard.sql - adds a timecard for a given employee and a 
       given date. Rudimentary checking is done, eg, 0 < logged_time < 24.
     get_emp_in_dept.sql - returns a list of all employees in a named
       department.
     get_emp_by_name.sql - returns the employee record for a named 
       employee.
     get_mthly_dept_rpt.sql - returns a report of hours worked by employee
       for a given department and a given date range.
     upd_rate.sql - updates the hourly rate for a particular employee.

  3) The test.xml file contains the test suite. You can run it with the
following command at the command prompt from the sqlunit root directory:
     ant sqlunit -Dtestfile=test/informix/test.xml

  4) If there are errors reported, they may be of either the SQLUnit variety
or the Java variety. Examples of the SQLUnit variety might include things
like variable mismatches and so on. Examples of the Java variety might
include things like NullPointerException and such, although I am pretty
confident that they wont appear. In case they do appear, you may get a 
better handle on it if you set the debug variable in SQLUnit.java to true.
You can choose to fix the code yourself or send the test results back to 
me, although the former would probably be less frustrating.
