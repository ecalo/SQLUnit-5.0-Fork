    <td valign="top"><b>Version 5.0 released. </b>This version contains numerous bug fixes and feature enhancements contributed by users. Andrew Arch contributed new data type mappings for SQL Server, Brent Herbert contributed a fix for jarfile-url handling for the SQLUnit tools, Ivan Ivanov has enhanced SQLUnit reporting to be able to configure multiple reporters in a single SQLUnit test run, Paul King has contributed a patch to allow referencing and manipulation of Ant property variables from within SQLUnit and has refactored the code to make it less Unix specific and work against the latest library JARs, Andreas Kutschera contributed a patch to allow an optional name attribute for the sqlunit element, Lenggi has contributed a patch to make SQLUnit work with MySQL 5 stored procedures, Douglas Kvidera has provided a patch to allow OUTPARAMs as nested UDTs, and Chabatox has provided a bug fix for problems with implicit symbol resolution in OUTPARAMs. Many thanks to Sathi Chowdhury and others who reported problems with the code. SQLUnit has also been made to compile with Java 1.5, and going forward, SQLUnit will be distributed as a Java 1.5 JAR file. The current code should also compile under Java 1.4, so you can rebuild the JAR locally with Java 1.4 if you choose, but upcoming versions may not.</td>

    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.9 released. </b>This version includes new tags for classifying tests into categories (classifiers) and skipping (skip) them based on a parameter, contributed by Ivan Ivanov, two new matchers contributed by Tim Cull, and a toolset to convert test output from the Canoo reporter to HTML contributed by James Henderson. Please see the user guide for more details. It also contains a bug fix to allow the caller to specify a type (class) name for user defined types, contributed by Greg Vatman. This release also contains fixes to correctly match outparams by id instead of by position and to have the include handler respect the transactional property of the Connection object it uses. Both these bugs were pointed out by James Henderson. SQLUnit also throws a full stack trace when it encounters an exception, regardless of whether it is in debug mode or not. This functionality was requested by Tim Cull.</td>

    <td valign="top"><b>May 24, 2005</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.8 released. </b>This version fixes problems with the partial attribute not working in the last release, because matching was done by position rather than index, pointed out by Meghanath and Chris Snow. The same fix has been applied for the assertion "outparams-equal", pointed out by Greg Vatman. A new attribute "echo" has been added to the result tag to make it easier to debug problems in tests. Two new assertions, "none" and "not-exception", which assert nothing and that no exception occured respectively, have been added, both requested by Meghanath. The ExpressionMatcher is also new in this release, which allows the caller to provide a <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jexl/reference/index.html">JEXL</a> expression in the match tag. This was built in response to a request for LessThan/GreaterThan matchers from Craeg Strong. The commons-jexl-1.0 and commons-logging libraries have been added to the distribution as a result. There is also a new TransformTool which allows callers to convert SQL information stored in proprietary XML to SQLUnit test XML files using XSLT, which was requested by Meghanath. Finally, based on a request from Greg Vatman to use SQLUnit in a web application environment, sqlunit.dtd is now shipped within the JAR file and is loaded as a resource. So the DOCTYPE for the SQLUnit tests can be specified simply by name and no longer needs to be specified as a relative or absolute URL, although the URL form will also work.</td>

    <td valign="top"><b>May 04, 2005</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.7 released. </b>This version fixes bugs in variable substitution from Ant build file for non-default connections, pointed out by Che, and a bug in handling of the setup element, where the set tags were being executed twice, pointed out by Mark Niggemann. This release introduces a new transaction-support attribute "implicit", to fix a backward compatibility issue introduced in version 4.6 (see warning below) pointed out by Mark Niggemann. It also introduces a new attribute "partial" for the resultset and row elements, to indicate to SQLUnit that the expected resultset and row are partially specified, and that it should attempt to match only what is specified. This feature was requested by Chris Snow. A special value "NONE" for the resultset attribute order-by has been introduced to tell SQLUnit not to sort the rows in the resultset. Another new feature, requested by Chris Snow, is the ability to specify value sets in the value list format of the foreach tag, where a set of values can be specified per element of the value list and referenced later by index.<br />
    <font color="red"><b>Warning: </b></font>Fixes to the transaction-support mode in version 4.6 may have created backward incompatible behavior for SQLUnit tests on Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server that run with transaction-support=off and CHAINED/IMPLICIT transaction mode. Please change the transaction-support attribute to "implicit" for these tests with SQLUnit 4.7 and later.<br /></td>

    <td valign="top"><b>April 13, 2005</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.6 released. </b>SQLUnit now has access to properties defined in the build.xml file for the calling SQLUnit Ant task when called from Ant. This feature was requested by Che. This version also contains fixes for bugs involving scaling for NUMERIC and DECIMAL data, first pointed out by James Henderson in version 4.4, problems with NULL values in the outparam and col tags, reported by James Henderson and Che, problems in SQLUnit when running without transaction-support, pointed out by Bern Holmes with a fix suggested by Jason Wilder, problems with debug information showing up in running in non-debug mode, pointed out by Oliver Hopton, and problems in autosorting NULL values, pointed out by James Henderson. In addition, xercesImpl.jar has been added to the lib directory in the distribution, and changes have been made to the build.xml to generate JavaCC artefacts into the src/net/sourceforge/sqlunit/parsers directory instead of src-gen/, mainly to make the code compile within the Eclipse IDE. Finally, the test.class parameter has been changed to testclass in the ant junit-test target to maintain parity with the testfile parameter for the sqlunit-flat target.</td>

    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.5 released. </b>This version fixes bugs in exception handling which caused SQLUnit to fail on a test which was designed to thrown an exception, and where user variables were carried through to subsequent suites instead of being localized to a single suite. Both bugs were reported by Kumar Krishnan</td>

It also contains code changes to make the process of adding new tags simpler, also suggested by Victor. The new version also has a more efficient version of SymbolTable.replaceVariables(), in response to concerns from Victor. It contains a fix for a bug in handling connections within a transactional context, pointed out by David Fishburn and Victor from different perspectives. It contains numerous small packaging improvements designed to make building SQLUnit from source and using SQLUnit locally, all suggested by David Fishburn. Finally, it contains a new assertion "resultset-types-equal" which allows you to match types only (ignoring value) when matching the results of a test. See the release notes for more information.</td>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>December 06, 2004</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.3 released. </b>This release fixes bugs with scaling issues in NUMERIC and DECIMAL datatypes, include file parsing problems for IF statements, and problems with reusing variables set as an lvalue from a SQL call, also reported. The first one was reported by James Henderson and the last two by David Fishburn. New features for this release include a completely rewritten GUITool from Arun Viswanath, a code contribution from Mark Niggemann which allows a user to set variables in SQLUnit from the results of Java method calls, and allowing the prepare tag within the diff tag. The mapping by which SQLUnit handles various datatypes from the database has been modified to conform to Sun's recommendations, so users dont have to make unnecessary type overrides. Thanks to James Henderson for pointing this out and supplying the link to the document.<br /><br />
    <font color="red"><b>Warning: </b></font>Since the mappings have changed, you may have to do some overriding if your tests were depending on the incorrect mappings. Here are the mappings which have changed.<br />

It contains a new matcher, the TypelessPercentageMatcher, contributed by Chris Watts. SQLUnit now supports putting match elements within test tags as well as diff tags, as well as a new assertion "resultset-values-equal", which ignores the type of the variable. This feature was requested by Chris Watts. SQLUnit now also allows terminating a SQL statement in included files with a trailing semi-colon. This feature was requested by Sathis Chitnis. The user-guide has gone back to the multi-page format, but based on a request from Brian E Dick, it provides links to a printable (single page HTML) and a downloadable version of the user guide. The documentation has been updated and new sections added. Some new SQLUnit mock tests have been added. Some more refactoring work has been done, and the source tree (src/) is now Checkstyle-compliant.</td>

    <td valign="top"><b>Version 4.0 released. </b>This release provides automatic sorting of resultsets by their natural order by default, and allows users to specify a non-default sort order if desired. This feature was requested by Jorge Orgarza. It also contains changes to the set tag to allow non-scalar sets using an embedded SQL or stored procedure call, a feature requested by James Henderson. SQLUnit now also allows custom asserts by specifying an assert attribute in the test, diff and batchtest tags. This feature was inspired by a chance remark from Matthew McEachen. David Fishburn has added a new suite of SQLUnit tests for Sybase ASA for this release. This release also contains some bug fixes for bugs reported by James Henderson when trying to run the MySQL tests. In addition, there has been a lot of refactoring, and the documentation has been considerably updated.<br />

This release allows specifying static variables in the SQL in the sql and call tags which will be replaced with values of variables defined earlier in the test, a feature requested by James Henderson. It also adds two new attributes expected-duration-millis and percentage-tolerance to the test tag to allow the caller to specify a time that the test should take (which is validated to be within the percentage-tolerance), a feature requested by Jorge Orgarza.</tr>

    <td valign="top"><b>Version 3.8 released</b>. This release contains:<br /> 
    - Two new handlers, MethodInvokerHandler and DynamicSqlHandler, developed by Mario Laureti.<br />
    - A new connection tag attribute @reconnect-on-failure which, when turned on, will destroy and recreate the connection in the event of a failure or exception in one of the tests. This feature was requested by David Fishburn, to work around a bug in the Sybase ASA JDBC driver which leaves the Connection in an inconsistent state when an exception occurs.<br />
    - SQLUnit now uses Jalopy to specify the preferred format for SQLUnit code. You can run ant jalopy-format to reformat the code in the contrib directory. This was mostly due to work done by Mario Laureti.<br />
    - Improvements to the Mock testing framework and a fairly complete mock regression test suite for SQLUnit.<br />
    - Bug fixes for LOB handling with MD5, and in the foreach tag which were discovered when trying to run the mock tests.<br />

Satheesh has also contributed a patch to fix a bug getting Connections using information from an external properties file. He has also contributed a sample SQLUnit test file for Oracle. This release also adds an extra name attribute for the param element for better readability, a feature requested by Satheesh. The release also contains some tweaks to the build.xml file to allow the user's CLASSPATH to be preserved when executing tasks from within the supplied build.xml file, a feature requested by David Fishburn and Ezra Epstein. To assist in debugging SQLUnit, both Satheesh and David requested that SQLUnit throw a stack trace when erroring out abnormally, and this feature has been added as well. David has also suggested numerous improvements in the process of making his tests run under SQLUnit, all of which have been implemented. This release also fixes some bugs with result matching, which was pointed out by Ezra Epstein. This release also allows testing cases where a return code and an exception is returned from a stored procedure, a feature requested by Ken Bowen. Finally, this version includes a Mock Testing framework for SQLUnit using the <a href="http://mockrunner.sourceforge.net">MockRunner project</a> which allows the SQLUnit team to field SQLUnit bugs on databases we do not own.

It adds a Foreach tag which allows you to run a batch of SQL statements with replaceable parameters which take their value from the current element in the foreach sequence. The Foreach element was suggested by Andrei Grigoriev, who later found a way to do this with native Oracle PL/SQL. The release also contains some feature enhancements requested by Andrei to make it more convenient to run large suites of tests, such as making SQLUnit throw its stack trace when a test fails, and outputting the name of the current test file being parsed.
