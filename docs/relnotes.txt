Bugs fixed in this release

   - Bugfix for jarfile-url handling, contributed by Brent Herbert. Allows
     jarfile-url functionality to be used for Tools.
   - Compiles cleanly under Java 1.5
   - Added Ivan Ivanov's patch for multiple reporters. This allows multiple
     reporters to be configured for a single SQLUnit test run.
