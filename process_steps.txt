Process steps for unit testing ETL code with my flavor of SQLUnit:

check out ETL code from tool repo
clone/pull tests from git repository
check for existing tests for your ETL or the objects that you will be reusing

if tests exist, you can use and build on them for you testing
if they dont, write new ones for your ETL

develop ETL AND unit tests simultaneously (cant really do TDD because we are only capable of blackbox testing at this point)
once ETL/test development is complete, run the unit tests locally before commiting to the repo

if your tests pass
check in code to tool repo
commit test and ETL code to repo
* committing test is a manual process using Git
* committing ETL code is automated because we must export from tool repo and import into Git using BATT

if your tests fail, iterate through the process again starting with your ETL/test development until the tests pass

When creating new tests, ensure that the name is equal to ${YOUR_OBJECT_NAME}_UT.xml for consistency.
